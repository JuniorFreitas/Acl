# Acl [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Samshal/Acl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Samshal/Acl)

This component adds a role based permission system for user authentication. In general, it provides a lightweight access control list for privileges and permission management.

It provides a flexible interface for creating Permissions, Roles, Resources and assigning the created permissions on roles.

This [gist](https://gist.github.com/Samshal/06dd964a0984b06c550476fb75edca1c) contains an instantiation example of the library and gives an idea of how the component works.
